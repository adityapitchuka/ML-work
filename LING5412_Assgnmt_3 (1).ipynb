screen theater . with us were a dozen other people . guess that hollywood is right . spending $60 million and producing a cartoon gets people a lot more interested that having a low budget classic picture with real actors and a heartwarming story . if i have had been at home and seeing this lassie movie on tv , i would have given up during the first 10 minutes . the initial plot setup and acting were too trite for me . what a caricature i thought . well , hang in there . the plot stays simple and predictable through out the entire movie , but you never mind because it is so life affirming . the bad boys do things like smoke for example . it is a simple fable , well told . there is even an extremely sweet subplot of a romance between the boy and a beautiful and slightly taller girl from his class . the scenes of lassie running up the hill , fording the stream , and bringing in the sheep are all so beautiful . the characters are simple without much depth , but this is a fairy tale not shakespeare . my 5 year old boy was quite scared ( much more than in the lion king ) several times during the show as lassie would get in serious trouble and would appear to be a goner . i recommend it with the warning that it could frighten little ones during the lassie in danger scenes or during the fist fight scene . i give it * * * which is the same rating i gave the lion king . if i had to choose between the two , i would choose lassie every time . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .\", \"cast : pierre richard , nino kirtadze , timur kamkhadze , micheline presle , jean-yves gautier director : nana dzhordzadze producer : marc ruscart screenplay : irakli kvirikadze cinematography : georgi beridze music : goran bregovic u . s . distributor : sony pictures classics in french and russian with subtitles a chef in love , georgia's entry into the 1997 academy awards sweepstakes , is a frustrating motion picture . frustrating , because this poorly-focused movie is guilty , first and foremost , of not taking advantage of its chief assets . films about food and culinary wizards are almost always evocative creations that tease the senses , even if they're imperfectly prepared . a chef in love barely tickles the palate , and certainly won't drive scores of movie-goers in search of a quality meal the way babette's feast did . the film is structured in an irritatingly non-chronological fashion . instead of presenting the narrative in a straightforward manner , director nana dzhordzadze and screenwriter irakli kvirikadze have decided to skip around in time , flashing back and forward to events during the 1920s , while presenting the entire story from the perspective of a man reading the chef's memoirs from 70 years in the future . although this approach isn't as chaotic as it sounds , it dilutes character development and leaves us floundering in our attempts to get a solid grip on the emotional core of the romance that lies at a chef in love's center . for films like pulp fiction and before the rain , the non-chronological structure was effective , because it amplified the plot . in a chef in love , there doesn't appear to be a compelling reason for it , and the jumps and cuts serve primarily to distract us from the story dzhordzadze is trying to tell . a chef in love purports to be about the enduring power of love ( even a revolution and all sorts of nasty characters can't kill what pascal and cecilia share ) , but the film's exploration of the subject matter isn't compelling . although dzhordzadze tries to trick us into believing that pascal and cecilia's romance is a great cinematic love affair , it comes across as incomplete and poorly-sketched . as a result , we're expected to accept them as passionate lovers simply because the screenplay tells us that they are . that's a cheat , and it's one of the reasons why a chef in love falters . the modern-day scenes in a chef in love are pointless . one revelation late in the film seemingly justifies the presence of these characters , but it's not all that effective because we don't spend enough time with anton and marcelle to know them as more than plot devices . the lead actors , pierre richard and nino kirtadze , are wonderful , and it's thanks to their efforts that we develop a genuine liking and sympathy for pascal and cecilia . richard is especially noteworthy , giving a performance that is both bigger than and full of life . despite being more subdued , kirtadze's portrayal is no less stirring . even as circumstances force cecilia into zigmund's arms , we sense that she will always love pascal , and only pascal , and that lends an element of effective tragedy to an otherwise- erratic story . unfortunately , few of the supporting actors do much with their roles . in particular , timur kamkhadze is disappointing because he is unable to develop zigmund into more than an almost-cartoonish villain . a chef in love is being marketed as a worthy successor to the likes of babette's feast and big night . however , it isn't in the same category as either , and not just because it doesn't truly tantalize our senses of taste and smell . when it comes to plot and character , both of those films possessed a richness that a chef in love fails to attain . with its melodramatic flourishes and confused , anecdotal approach , this movie is frequently overdone or underdone , but rarely cooked to perfection .\", \"screenplay : robert harling . director : robert harling . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 130 minutes . the evening star has so much good will working for it from the start that it would have taken an effort to make it a complete catastrophe . screenwriter and director robert harling is well-aware of this history , and his opening credits sequence tries to make the most of it . over pictures of maclaine , debra winger and jeff daniels , michael gore's familiar terms of endearment theme plays , working that good will like a boxer works the body to soften up the opponent . the unintended effect of these familiar signifiers , however , is to remind you how much more focused and satisfying a film terms was than the evening star . the key to the success of terms of endearment lay in its pitch-perfect study of a contentious mother-daughter relationship , yet it is not exactly because emma is absent that the evening star feels less potent . that one relationship focused terms , however ; you knew exactly what it was really about . the evening star is in desperate need of that kind of focus . harling throws a lot of stuff at the screen , and some of it sticks , notably some exceptional moments for ross and a few catty exchanges between maclaine and richardson . unfortunately , there isn't enough of the stuff that works , and plenty of down time as harling searches for a narrative deserving of aurora's fire . shirley maclaine obviously has a blast returning to the role of aurora , and that obvious joy is likely to bring an audience with her farther than the material itself deserves . aurora preens deliciously after she spends the night with jerry , smiles a venomous smile as she catches patsy in a deception , and generally makes overbearing motherhood her own personal fiefdom ; it's just plain fun to spend time with a character this colorful . if only maclaine hadn't made so many of aurora's quirks so familiar by taking on a succession of infuriating-but-lovable roles distinguishable from one another only by the film in which they appeared -- steel magnolias , postcards from the edge , guarding tess , mrs . all found maclaine doing riffs on aurora with varying degrees of success , and even a lively performance feels recycled after so many precursors . it doesn't feel at all like we have missed over a decade of aurora greenway's life . we've just been watching her using aliases . it is one of nicholson's best and most restrained pieces of film acting in years ; he seems both genuinely pleased to see his old love , and genuinely unsure about how to interact with her . there is so much affection and charm in those few scenes , as all the soap opera plot developments and histrionics take a breather , that it almost feels like 1983 all over again .\", 'persuasion is a perfect movie . i have never read it so the story was totally fresh . on the other hand , this movie is so good that if i had read the book a thousand times , i would still have left me awe struck by the acting and the production . i do hope all of the academy members see this show . it deserves awards in a myriad of categories . root is a british shakespearean actress , and this is her first film . it is one of the most auspicious beginnings for a movie actress i can remember . she is an actress on the plain side of homely who transforms every scene she is in into a magical moment and yet she spends most of the movie just listening and giving the most expressive , pensive , frequently sad , but always compelling expressions i can remember . she says more by saying nothing than most actresses do with a whole movie full of dialog . it was entirely prudent of you to reject him . \" if it reminded me of any movie it was probably the unforgettable the age of innocence . the script by nick dear , based on the austin novel , is full of memorable lines , but the great direction by first time director roger mitchell relies more on silence and on expressions than on the words to carry the emotion of the tale . she says , \" you presume to know me \" , and he replies , \" in my heart i know you intimately . \" we also have , a la the age of innocence , an extremely effective brief hand holding scene . the height of passion is reached in the show with a single , quick kiss . fast it may be , the effect is total . besides root\\'s acting , which should put her on the short list for an oscar , the performance by hinds is almost as good . in fact , all of the rest of the cast are excellent . there is not even a mediocre performance . the craft of the movie itself is phenomenal . never has candle lit scenes been more effectively and lovingly done . watch the extreme length of the candle flames and how the camera shots through and around them . daly\\'s technique of shooting indoor scenes closer up than normal gives an intimacy and presence that i have not seen before . in scenes that normally would have been filmed further back , like the ones of the indoor dancing , he uses handheld cameras and stays in tight on the faces and even uses panning without making the audience dizzy . several times he lets the camera linger on a person photographic style even when the character has no speaking parts . they add to the movie enormously without the usual in your face period pieces that are overdone . there are many fine examples of this but my favorite is the clothes and especially the navy hat that the captain sometimes wears . the look tells us more about his character than many pages of dialog would have . the make up artist is extremely talented . watch carefully for the subtle but important changes in ann\\'s makeup as the story develops . although there are tragedies in the movie that will take your breath away , the story is one mainly of carefully controlled and checked emotions . finally , the movie ends as well as it begins . i can not use it here as it gives away a key fact , but it is a perfect statement to his obliviousness and an excellent end to the story . it is a g movie that is rated pg since it will probably bore kids under 8 . there is absolutely nothing in it to offend anyone of any age . i most strongly recommend this movie to you , and i give it my rarely awarded top rating of * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don\\'t waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer\\'s .', 'it may not rank with alexander graham bell\\'s idea of long distance voice communication , but the team at govworks . com does have a vision . startup . com , the engrossing and enlightening documentary about govworks by chris hegedus and jehane noujaim , argues convincingly , if only by implication , that for the company\\'s founders , tom herman and kaleil isaza tuzman , it isn\\'t about creating \" insanely great \" products , as steve jobs would say , but about making insanely large amounts of money . about the only song in the film is \" money ( that\\'s all i want ) , \" which just about sums up the approach of these two hard-working entrepreneurs . there probably are worker bees toiling away in the background who passionately believe in their product , but what we see are a couple of 28-year-old guys who dream of getting rich . both of them are likable guys who you want to win but who seem headed for disaster . just like the movie titanic , startup . com is fascinating even if we feel certain that the company will sink in the end . expect to see these guys on the business talk shows again . it is rated r for brief language and would be acceptable for any kid old enough to be interested in the subject . just send me a letter with the word \" subscribe \" in the subject line
